During those years (2010-2012), the entire mining ecosystem was growing, and so many things started to change: as seen in Chapter \ref{chapt:mining}, network hashrate was increasing, solo mining was slowly disappearing, and mining equipment was becoming more powerful year after year.\\
Getwork method was the only mining protocol that was used at that time, but, as we've seen before, it permitted miners to change only the 32 bits of original nonce field in the header received from bitcoind. In addition to those 4 bytes of nonce space, miners could exploit the nTime field of the header (thanks to the RollNtime extension that was supported by most mining pools at that epoch). 
Anyway, one getwork job was enough for a 4.2GHash/s (${2^{32}}$ bits) mining rig and (thanks to nTime rolling) this job was usable for one minute or until a new Bitcoin block arrived (depending on what happened first). Beyond that, a block created from massively modified nTime could/can be rejected by the Bitcoin network.\\
That maximum rate was extremely too low for the mining performances of the newest equipment of that period, so an alternative needed to be found.
Fortunately, a group of Bitcoin Core developers specialized in mining operations, worked very hard during 2012, to show up a valid alternative to the standard getwork method: they developed the so called getblocktemplate method or GBT.\\
The enhancements brought by GBT will be deeply explained and described in the next chapter, which will be followed by the chapter focused on Stratum: the pooled mining protocol which became the standard "de facto" nowadays. It was developed at the same time of getblocktemplate, from the big effort of the developer called \textit{slush}, the founder of the first mining pool ever created, \textit{slushpool}.\\\\
The official removal of Getwork method from Bitcoin Core had been proposed on 16th August 2013, through the Pull Request \#2905 \cite{bitcoincorepull2905}.
To dig into more details of the removal, a very interesting discussion can be found on Bitcoin Talk Forum \cite{bitcointalkRFCRemoval}.
